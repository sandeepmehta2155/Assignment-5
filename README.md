#Javascript Assignment 5

1) Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder, Sphere and
Cone with four decimal places using objects and classes.
Create classes for volumes for each geometric shape which returns the
output using the getVolume() method.

eg- to get volume of cylinder-
let obj= new Cylinder(radius,height);

obj.getVolume();

Formulas for volumes of the shapes-
1) Cylinder- Volume = πr

2h

where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
2)Sphere- Volume= 4/3πr
3
where r is the radius
3) Cone- Volume= πr
2h/3

where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone.
